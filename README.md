<h1>Hi, I'm Ian! </h1>

<h2>Further About me</h2>

Hi, as you know now my name is Ian Wright and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering while also pursuing a Minor in Mathematics. I am currently interested in working with UAV's and Robotics as I see these to platforms having the most improvement to technology. I am pursuing my interest by currently getting into Arduinos and Raspberry Pi to deepen my knowledge in circuits and electronics that classes cant teach. I am also currently working in Dr. Goels [Estimation, Control, and Learning Laboratory(ECLL)](https://estimation-control-learning-laboratory.github.io/) where I am deepening my knowledge in controls starting with working on an [Inverted Reaction Pendulum](https://github.com/IamWright1/Inverted-Reaction-Pendulum) project. Here is my [Resume](https://github.com/IamWright1/IamWright1/blob/main/All%20Time%20resume.pdf) with everything I have done, and Feel free to contact me through my [email](mailto:iwright1@umbc.edu).
